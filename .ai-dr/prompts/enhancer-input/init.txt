1. Set up core rules for what we have now (don't go out of scope for now)
    - Next.js 15+ App Router
    - Tailwind CSS V4
    - Shadcn + Radix UI + AI Elements
    - TypeScript v5
    - Bun
    - React 19+
    - Ruler for AI rules
2. Set up MCP's for project
    - Playwright for testing
    - Context7
    - Sequential Thinking
3. Set up prompt creation for workflow building

Here is the input and output of my attempt at using an enhance script. I am wondering if it was able to get any context files or not, and if it did not, it should say no relevant files to add. How can we get it to look for relevant files on it's own intelligently? I want to integrate a system that intelligently uses the filesystem to develop a ranking based system with security premeasures to guard against sending sensitive files. It should only include files if the confidence percentage is higher than a set measure that makes sense and is configurable. I have no idea how to do this, so I need you to figure it out with some web research and planning first. The goal is to use this library https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/llms.txt which I need you to add to @docs/documentation-links.md and plan a solution as to how to integrate it into our @packages/prompt-enhancer/ as an **optional** component so that it doesn't have to be included unless user configures it properly.
