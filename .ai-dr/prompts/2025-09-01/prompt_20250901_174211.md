# User Prompt

this is my monorepo template that I setup here. I want you to make sure that it is well setup as a template, and that it's all as a user going to be straightforward to get started with and vibe. We need to ensure the README.md has clear instructions for setup, and perhpas even automate the setup as much as we can. Ensure to follow what is in our codebase, and not go out of scope. Note that a lot of this is copy pasta from other repos, and I did my best to clean up, but I may have left residue that doesn't make sense for a template or is erroneously there still that I would like you to make right. Keep it simple and as seamless and easily configurable for a user as possible, but don't do too much as it's already pretty damn good I believe. Review for security as well to make sure I didn't leave my personal user settings or file paths. If so, just change home directory, allowing the setup to replace it with the user's home directory with safety guards always prompting the user before running any commands in a setup script. Ensure the env examples also make sense, that the app runs in development, typecheck passes, lint passes, you can hit the web endpoint on a browser and it loads properly without error, and the db setup scripts from the root pass
