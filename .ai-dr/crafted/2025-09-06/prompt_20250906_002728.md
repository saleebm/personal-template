## Instruction
As an expert software engineer, your task is to design, propose, and outline the implementation of robust and practically applied GitHub Actions for this monorepo project. Your solution should leverage the `gh cli` for research and adhere strictly to the provided project rules and technical stack. The goal is to move beyond basic automation, focusing on 'super thinking actions' that enhance the project's reliability, maintainability, and development workflow, addressing any potential 'fragility' in current or future processes.

## Context
**Project Overview**: AI Dr. workflow orchestration system
**Technical Stack**: TypeScript, Bun
### Relevant Files
- `.github/workflows/`: File: .github/workflows/
- `package.json`: File: package.json
- `tsconfig.json`: File: tsconfig.json
- `bun.lockb`: File: bun.lockb
- `scripts/`: File: scripts/
- `packages/**/package.json`: File: packages/**/package.json
- `apps/**/package.json`: File: apps/**/package.json
### Dependencies
- @intellectronica/ruler
- @types/bun
- @types/minimatch
- @workspace/eslint-config
- @workspace/typescript-config
- minimatch
- prettier
- turbo
- typescript

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Demonstrate a clear understanding of GitHub Actions capabilities, specifically as discoverable via `gh cli --help` and relevant documentation.
2. ✅ Provide a well-structured proposal for a set of GitHub Actions, clearly articulating their purpose, triggers, and the specific `bun` commands they will execute (e.g., `bun build`, `bun typecheck`, `bun test`, `bun lint`, `bun format`, `bun dev`).
3. ✅ Proposed GitHub Actions must integrate seamlessly with the project's `Bun` and `TypeScript` technical stack.
4. ✅ Ensure all proposed actions adhere to the project's coding standards, including Single Responsibility Principle for scripts, appropriate naming conventions, and robust error handling.
5. ✅ All secrets and sensitive configurations within GitHub Actions must be managed securely using GitHub Secrets and environment variables, strictly following the 'Never commit secrets to git' and 'Server-only' rules from the Security Guidelines.
6. ✅ The design of GitHub Actions must prioritize robustness and maintainability, actively mitigating potential 'fragility' as implied by the original prompt.
7. ✅ Provide a detailed implementation plan, including recommended file locations within `.github/workflows/` and any necessary updates to project configuration files (e.g., `package.json`).
8. ✅ Document the rationale behind the proposed actions, explaining their value and how they contribute to a 'best practical application in real world context'.
9. ✅ Confirm that no generated agent files (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) are directly edited; all rule changes must originate from `.ruler/`.

## Constraints
- ⚠️ All GitHub Actions must primarily use `bun` for package management and script execution, adhering to the 'Use Bun Instead of Node.js' rule.
- ⚠️ Custom scripts executed within GitHub Actions, if any, must be written in TypeScript and conform to the project's TypeScript Standards (e.g., no `any`, strict types, absolute imports).
- ⚠️ Adhere to the 'Development Workflow' for the standard sequence of checks: `bun dev`, `bun typecheck`, `bun test`, `bun lint`.
- ⚠️ Secrets must be stored in GitHub Secrets and accessed via environment variables, following the 'Security Guidelines' strictly (e.g., `process.env["VARIABLE_NAME"]` for server-only variables).
- ⚠️ Any new files (e.g., workflow YAMLs, helper scripts) must follow 'Coding Standards' for naming (kebab-case for files/directories) and 'Project Architecture' for organization (e.g., not in root, modular).
- ⚠️ Documentation for newly created GitHub Actions or significant modifications must be provided, potentially as `README.md` files within the `.github/workflows/` directory, following 'Documentation Management Rules' principles.
- ⚠️ The solution must not involve directly editing any files in the `.ruler/` directory unless the task explicitly becomes about modifying agent behavior rules. GitHub Actions themselves are not agent rules.

## Clarifying Questions
1. ❓ Are there any existing GitHub Actions that need to be reviewed, refactored, or replaced?
2. ❓ What specific pain points or areas of 'fragility' in the current development or deployment workflow are most critical to address with new GitHub Actions?
3. ❓ What are the desired triggers for these new 'super thinking actions'? (e.g., push to specific branches, pull request creation/update, scheduled events, manual dispatch)

## Expected Output
**Format**: structured_data
**Structure**: Structured output

## Inputs
- **Original Prompt** (text): could you use the gh cli command and the --help option as needed to see how github actions worked in reality to then help me resolve and 
  upstart super thinking actions by your own super thinking - focus on best practical application in real world context, understanding the 
  app as a template to be branched like a seed in the forest from where it traces routes has become a fragility in upon itself. But seriously, look what those github actions construe upon themselves into the blossom sprung in thy and why would it be there 2?

## Validation
**Status**: ✅ Valid
**Score**: 100/100
